## Description

A streamlit-based data fiting and analysis app. It has features such as: polynomial, exponential and natural logaritmic curve fitting, and statistical distributions

## Usage
Input: csv file with 2 columns: x entries, y entries. Must have matching pairs. OR maually enter data sets
Output: Graph with curve fitted (default polnomial of degree 1) use sliders and text inputs to change curve/analysis tools 

## Challenges
Implementing curve fitting functions and probability density with the same input method. 
Building Polynomial equation for display

## What was Learned

Through the completion of this project I learned a lot about curve fitting, probability density calculations, and linear regression. Additionally as my first streamlit based app, this was a strong introduction to streamlit.
