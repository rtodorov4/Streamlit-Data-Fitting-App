##Description /n
A streamlit-based data fiting and analysis app. It has features such as: polynomial, exponential and natural logaritmic curve fitting, and statistical distributions

What was learned
Through the completion of this project I learned a lot about curve fitting, probability density calculations, and linear regression. Additionally as my first streamlit based app, this was a strong introduction to streamlit.
